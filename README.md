# stubUnit

Allows for the population of a long-chain / complex hierarchy of dto relationships for use 
in unit testing.  

See sample unit test for examples on how to use. 

Note the distinction between stubs and mocks.  Mocks are actual object replacements that are
performed to usually override specific operations or methods. Whereas stubs are actual 
instances of objects that are used during testing.
